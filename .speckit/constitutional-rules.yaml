veto_protocol:
  security_veto:
    trigger: "Claude identifies HIGH or CRITICAL security risk"
    action: |
      1. Pipeline halts immediately
      2. Claude must provide: risk description, attack scenario, remediation
      3. GPT-5 reviews veto justification
      4. If veto valid: Qwen re-implements with Claude's guidance
      5. If veto invalid: GPT-5 documents override reason and proceeds
    appeals: "Only GPT-5 can override Claude security veto with written justification"
  quality_veto:
    trigger: "Claude identifies MEDIUM risk or code quality issues"
    action: |
      1. Pipeline continues but flags issue
      2. GPT-5 decides: fix now vs technical debt backlog
      3. If fix now: Qwen addresses in same PR
      4. If backlog: Creates tracking task
  infrastructure_veto:
    trigger: "Gemini identifies cost/quota/reliability risk"
    action: |
      1. Pipeline pauses for GPT-5 review
      2. Gemini must provide: cost estimate, alternative approach
      3. GPT-5 decides: proceed, optimize, or defer

conflict_resolution:
  qwen_vs_claude:
    scenario: "Qwen's implementation differs from Claude's review suggestion"
    resolver: GPT-5
    process: |
      1. GPT-5 requests test results from both approaches
      2. Claude explains technical reasoning
      3. Qwen defends spec adherence
      4. GPT-5 chooses based on: security > performance > maintainability > spec literalism
  claude_vs_gemini:
    scenario: "Claude suggests code change that requires GCP reconfiguration Gemini advises against"
    resolver: GPT-5
    process: |
      1. Estimate impact: cost, reliability, timeline
      2. If cost < $100/month: Claude's approach wins
      3. If reliability risk: Gemini's approach wins
      4. Else: GPT-5 finds compromise
  spec_ambiguity:
    scenario: "Agent interprets SPEC.md differently than intended"
    resolver: GPT-5
    process: |
      1. GPT-5 updates SPEC.md with clarification
      2. Re-assigns task with updated spec
      3. Logs ambiguity for future template improvement

approval_requirements:
  schema_changes:
    requires: [gpt5, claude]
    reason: "Database changes are irreversible and high-risk"
  dependency_additions:
    requires: [gpt5, claude]
    reason: "New dependencies increase attack surface"
  api_contract_changes:
    requires: [gpt5, claude]
    reason: "Breaking changes affect clients"
  deployment:
    requires: [gpt5, gemini]
    must_pass: [tests, smoke_tests, view_verification]
    reason: "Production changes need infra validation"
